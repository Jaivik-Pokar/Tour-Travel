                Travel management is a specialized business function that
                balances employee needs with corporate goal,financial and
                otherwise. Travel management ensures cost tracking and control,
                facilities adherence tocorporate travel policies, realizes
                saving throught negotiated discounts, and serves as a valuable
                information center for employees and managers intimes when
                travel is not as smooth and culture as it used to be.
                <br /><br />
                The economic downturn has allowed travel managers to take a
                front and cneter role within their companies and has made travel
                management,as a profession, an important part of every top
                executive's strategic planinig. In many cases, travel manages
                have beenasked to lead company-wide efforts to cut travel
                costs,,track those saving and report thm back to senoir
                management.
                <br /><br />
                But travel management is still misunderstood and undervalued by
                some corporation today. Therefore, the role of business travel
                within corporate structure must be placed in proper context so
                thatits value can bre measured and appreciated.
